# Days Of My Life

This little project will be a simple journal which lets you write about each day through your life. 

Hopefully the project will be available featuring full offline syncing once it's ready, enabling it to be packed with Cordova natively and with Polimer I am hoping I can create a hybrid too. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
